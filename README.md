# Bridge-To-Nowhere
This project for a Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at University.

In our project we found the maximum optimal solution for connoting the two side of the country without crossing the bridges using the longest common subsequence Algorithm.
In this project we learn how to reuse another algorithms in our solution, and how to visualize our solution by using GUI and JGraphT Library.
