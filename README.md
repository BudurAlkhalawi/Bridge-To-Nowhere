# Bridge-To-Nowhere
This project for a Design and Analysis of Algorithms course at University.

In our project we found the maximum optimal solution for connecting the two side of the country without crossing the bridges using the longest common subsequence Algorithm.
We reuse another algorithms in our solution, and visualize our solution by using GUI and JGraphT Library.
